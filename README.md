This repo leverages 4 different data sources that focus on different stats involving:
-Defense vs. Position
-Individual player game logs
-Season Long Team Defense
-Player postions and teams

The purpose of the script is to 1. pull this data, 2. clean/aggregate the data, and 3. export in csv format. From there, I update a google sheets dashboard that tracks and highlights weekly player matchups using this information.
